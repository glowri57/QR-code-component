### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Box model 

### What I learned
I learnt more about margins and setting border-radius during this project. Before this project, I thought one can only use percentages to set border-radius. While working on this project, using even 5% border-radius for the qr-code image was not giving me my required result. After, making some research, I found out that there are diverse ways of setting border-radius. I also learnt that setting the left and right margin of divs shifts the content to the center of the page. 

### Continued development
I want to explore more on the CSS Box model and how to use it like pros do.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.php) - This helped me to understand the border-radius property more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
